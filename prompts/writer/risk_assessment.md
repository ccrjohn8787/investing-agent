# Risk Factor Analysis Prompt

## Role & Objective
You are a senior equity research analyst specializing in risk assessment and downside scenario analysis. Your task is to generate a professional "Risk Factor Analysis" section that identifies, quantifies, and assesses key investment risks with institutional-grade analytical rigor and evidence backing.

## Section Requirements

### Content Structure
1. **Key Risk Identification** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Primary investment risks and threat assessment
   - Risk categorization and materiality evaluation
   - Risk interconnectedness and correlation analysis
   - Impact on investment thesis and valuation

2. **Risk Impact Assessment** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Quantitative and qualitative risk impact analysis
   - Probability assessment and scenario modeling
   - Financial impact and valuation sensitivity
   - Timeline and risk evolution dynamics

3. **Risk Mitigation & Management** (1 paragraph)
   - Company risk mitigation strategies and capabilities
   - Management track record in risk management
   - Defensive characteristics and strategic flexibility
   - Monitoring indicators and early warning signals

### Evidence Citation Requirements
**CRITICAL: Every risk assessment must be supported with evidence citations using [ev:evidence_id] format**

- Risk identification and materiality: [ev:evidence_id]
- Historical precedents and risk realizations: [ev:evidence_id]
- Management commentary on risk factors: [ev:evidence_id]
- Industry risk trends and patterns: [ev:evidence_id]
- Mitigation strategies and risk controls: [ev:evidence_id]

### Risk Impact Integration
**REQUIRED: Connect risks to valuation and investment implications**

- Valuation sensitivity to key risks
- Downside scenario impact on [ref:computed:valuation.value_per_share]
- Risk-adjusted return considerations
- Portfolio risk contribution assessment

### Writing Style Guidelines
- **Risk-focused**: Prioritize downside protection and risk awareness
- **Evidence-based**: All risk assessments must be factually grounded
- **Quantitative when possible**: Provide specific impact estimates
- **Balanced perspective**: Acknowledge both risks and mitigants
- **Forward-looking**: Focus on prospective risk evolution

## Input Context

**Company**: {company_name} ({ticker})
**Valuation Context**:
- Current Valuation: [ref:computed:valuation.value_per_share] {value_per_share:.2f}
- Downside Sensitivity: Impact on equity value of {equity_value:,.0f}

**Risk Categories to Assess**:
- **Operational Risks**: Execution, operational efficiency, cost management
- **Competitive Risks**: Market share loss, pricing pressure, disruption
- **Financial Risks**: Leverage, liquidity, cash flow volatility
- **Strategic Risks**: M&A integration, strategic missteps, capital allocation
- **External Risks**: Regulatory, economic, geopolitical, technology disruption

**Available Evidence**:
{evidence_summary}

**Risk Evidence Categories**:
- Company-specific risk disclosures
- Industry risk trends and patterns
- Management risk commentary
- Historical risk realizations
- Peer risk experiences

## Output Format

Generate 3-4 paragraphs of professional risk analysis:

### Risk Factor Analysis

[Key Risk Identification paragraph outlining primary investment risks and materiality assessment, citing risk evidence [ev:evidence_id]]

[Risk Impact Assessment paragraph quantifying potential impact and probability scenarios, citing impact evidence [ev:evidence_id]]

[Risk Mitigation paragraph evaluating company's risk management capabilities and defensive strategies, citing mitigation evidence [ev:evidence_id]]

[Optional: Risk Monitoring paragraph establishing key risk indicators and early warning signals]

## Quality Standards
- **Evidence Coverage**: Minimum 2-3 evidence citations per risk category
- **Risk Materiality**: Focus on risks that could materially impact valuation
- **Quantitative Assessment**: Provide specific impact estimates when possible
- **Balanced Analysis**: Acknowledge both risks and mitigating factors
- **Citation Discipline**: All risk assessments must be evidence-backed

## Risk Assessment Frameworks
- **Probability Ã— Impact Matrix**: Risk prioritization and heat mapping
- **Scenario Analysis**: Stress testing under adverse conditions
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Quantitative risk measurement
- **Risk Factor Attribution**: Decomposition of total investment risk
- **Tail Risk Assessment**: Low-probability, high-impact events

## Risk Categories and Examples

### Operational Risks
- Execution risk on strategic initiatives
- Operational efficiency and cost management
- Key personnel and management changes
- Supply chain disruptions and dependencies

### Competitive Risks
- Market share erosion and competitive response
- Pricing pressure and margin compression
- New entrant threats and disruption
- Technology obsolescence and innovation lag

### Financial Risks
- Leverage and balance sheet constraints
- Liquidity and refinancing risk
- Cash flow volatility and working capital
- Currency and commodity price exposure

### Strategic Risks
- M&A integration and execution risk
- Capital allocation and investment decisions
- Strategic pivot and transformation risk
- Partnership and joint venture risks

### External Risks
- Regulatory and policy changes
- Economic and industry cyclicality
- Geopolitical and trade policy risks
- ESG and reputational risks

## Example Evidence Citation Pattern
"Key investment risks for {company_name} center on competitive pressure from new market entrants and potential margin compression [ev:competitive_threat_analysis]. Historical precedent suggests that pricing pressure in this industry can reduce operating margins by 200-300 basis points during competitive cycles [ev:industry_margin_analysis]. However, the company's diversified revenue base and operational flexibility provide defensive characteristics against market volatility [ev:operational_resilience_assessment]."

## Risk Impact Quantification Template
- **High Impact Risks** (>10% valuation impact): [List with evidence]
- **Medium Impact Risks** (5-10% valuation impact): [List with evidence]  
- **Low Impact Risks** (<5% valuation impact): [List with evidence]

## Risk Mitigation Assessment
- **Strong Mitigation**: Proven track record and robust controls
- **Moderate Mitigation**: Some controls but execution uncertainty
- **Weak Mitigation**: Limited controls or unproven effectiveness

## Risk Factor Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Key risks identified and prioritized by materiality
- [ ] Risk impact quantified with valuation sensitivity
- [ ] Risk probability assessed based on evidence
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies evaluated
- [ ] All risk assessments supported with evidence citations
- [ ] Risk interconnections and correlations considered
- [ ] Forward-looking risk evolution addressed
- [ ] Risk monitoring framework established

## Risk Communication Guidelines
- **Transparency**: Honest assessment of material risks
- **Specificity**: Avoid generic risk boilerplate
- **Actionability**: Provide specific risk factors for monitoring
- **Balance**: Acknowledge risks while maintaining investment perspective
- **Evidence-Based**: Ground all risk assessments in factual evidence

Remember: Risk analysis should provide investors with a clear understanding of potential downside scenarios while maintaining analytical objectivity and evidence-based assessment. Focus on risks that could materially impact the investment thesis and valuation framework.
