## Writing Instructions

### Opening: Competitive Context
Establish the company's strategic position within the competitive landscape:

```
[COMPANY] operates in a [COMPETITIVE_INTENSITY] environment characterized by [MARKET_DYNAMICS with citations]. The company's competitive positioning reflects [STRATEGIC_APPROACH] relative to key rivals, with [DIFFERENTIATION_FACTORS] driving [COMPETITIVE_OUTCOMES].

- **Sustainable Advantages**: Barriers that protect market position
- **Strategic Vulnerabilities**: Areas where competitors have advantages
- **Innovation Positioning**: Technology leadership and R&D capabilities

**2. Competitive Benchmarking**
Compare performance metrics against peer group:

```
[COMPANY]'s operating margins of [X]% compare favorably to the peer median of [ref:computed:peer_analysis.industry_medians.operating_margin]%, reflecting [STRATEGIC_FACTORS with citations]. This performance differential of [X]bps suggests [COMPETITIVE_ADVANTAGE_SOURCE].
```

**3. Market Position Dynamics**
Assess market share trends and competitive evolution:

- **Market Share Evolution**: Historical trends and trajectory
- **Competitive Gains/Losses**: Specific wins/losses vs. key rivals

**Benchmarking Language:**

### Evidence Integration Examples

**Market Share Analysis:**
[COMPANY] has gained 250bps of market share over three years `[ev:market_research_q4_2024]`, primarily at the expense of [COMPETITOR] which lost 180bps `[ev:competitive_landscape_analysis]`, indicating effective execution of [STRATEGIC_INITIATIVE] `[ev:management_commentary_earnings]`.

**Competitive Advantage:**
The company's proprietary technology platform processes 10x more transactions per second than nearest competitor `[ev:technical_benchmarking_study]`, creating substantial switching costs estimated at $2-5M for enterprise customers `[ev:customer_survey_switching_costs]`.

**Financial Performance:**
[COMPANY]'s 23% EBITDA margins exceed the peer median of [ref:computed:peer_analysis.industry_medians.ebitda_margin]% by 400bps, driven by superior operational efficiency `[ev:operational_metrics_comparison]` and pricing power from differentiated offerings `[ev:pricing_analysis_report]`.
