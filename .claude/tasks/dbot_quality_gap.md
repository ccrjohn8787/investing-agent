# DBOT Quality Gap Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Transform the current numbers-focused valuation system into a story-to-numbers approach matching the quality demonstrated in the DBOT paper's BYD report, with research-once-then-freeze architecture for scientific rigor and reproducibility.

## Background Context

**Current State:**
- Robust valuation engine (Ginzu) with deterministic NumPy calculations ✅
- Complete data pipeline from EDGAR, Yahoo/Stooq, UST sources ✅
- Basic agent structure with LLM integration framework ✅
- Comprehensive evaluation and testing infrastructure ✅
- Basic template-based report generation with minimal narrative context
- Limited strategic analysis and industry context

**Target State (BYD Report Quality):**
- Rich storytelling connecting numbers to business reality
- Industry context and competitive positioning analysis  
- Strategic narrative with bull/bear scenarios
- Compelling titles and thematic structure
- Forward-looking market dynamics integration
- Research-once-then-freeze architecture for reproducibility
- Full auditability with evidence→driver change tracking

**Quality Gap Identified:**
Current META report is purely numeric with minimal narrative. The BYD report demonstrates:
- Industry context and competitive analysis
- Strategic narrative connecting numbers to business reality  
- Market dynamics and forward-looking perspectives
- Compelling titles and thematic structure
- Detailed macro-economic context integration
- Professional-grade investment thesis development

## Strategic Approach: Research-Once-Then-Freeze Architecture

Following the enhanced DBOT approach with scientific rigor:
- **Single Research Pass:** Run comprehensive research during waterfall, map evidence to driver deltas via code under caps, then freeze evidence set
- **Story-to-Numbers:** Rich narrative citing evidence IDs, but writer never creates numbers
- **Full Auditability:** Model-PR log tracks every evidence→driver change with `{evidence_id, target, before→after, rule, cap_hit}`
- **Hard Gates:** Objective metrics block CI (evidence_coverage ≥ 0.80, citation_density ≥ 0.70), LLM judge advises

## Implementation Priorities

### Priority 0: LLM-Based Report Evaluation Framework (CRITICAL FOUNDATION)
**Status:** Ready to Start
**Description:** Build evaluation system that grades reports like Professor Damodaran or investment professionals would, using sub-agent for development
**Dependencies:** None (Foundation for all other work)

**Key Components:**
- LLM judge sub-agent for holistic report evaluation  
- Hard metric gates for CI: evidence_coverage ≥ 0.80, citation_density ≥ 0.70, contradiction_rate ≤ 0.20, fixture_stability = true
- Multi-dimensional rubric scoring system
- BYD report as evaluation benchmark and gold standard
- Evaluation pipeline that runs on Markdown output (not HTML)

**Detailed Sub-Tasks:**
- [ ] **Use sub-agent to analyze existing evaluation structure** in `evals/` directory and `tests/evals/`
- [ ] **Create `report_quality_judge` agent** with professional evaluation criteria
  - Strategic insight scoring (0-10): depth of industry analysis, competitive positioning, forward-looking perspective
  - Narrative coherence scoring (0-10): logical flow, clear investment thesis, compelling storytelling
  - Analytical rigor scoring (0-10): evidence quality, citation discipline, quantitative backing
  - Professional presentation scoring (0-10): formatting, visual integration, clarity
- [ ] **Build comprehensive rubric framework** covering:
  - Strategic insight: industry context, competitive dynamics, market positioning, growth drivers
  - Investment thesis quality: clear bull/bear cases, scenario analysis, risk factors
  - Citation discipline: evidence coverage, source attribution, no uncited claims
  - Narrative depth: storytelling quality, executive summary effectiveness, compelling conclusions
- [ ] **Implement BYD report as evaluation benchmark** with detailed scoring framework
  - Parse BYD report sections and score each dimension
  - Create comparative scoring system: current report vs BYD standard
  - Set target thresholds: strategic insight ≥8/10, narrative coherence ≥8/10, analytical rigor ≥9/10
- [ ] **Create evaluation cases for different report types:**
  - Technology companies (high growth, innovation focus): META, GOOGL, NVDA
  - Industrial/Manufacturing (cyclical, capital intensive): BYD reference, CAT, BA
  - Consumer/Retail (brand/competitive moats): AMZN, COST, WMT
  - Financial services (regulatory/macro sensitive): JPM, BAC, BRK
- [ ] **Set up hard metric gates in CI** alongside LLM judge
  - evidence_coverage: % of claims backed by evidence IDs ≥ 0.80
  - citation_density: evidence citations per paragraph ≥ 0.70  
  - contradiction_rate: conflicting claims within report ≤ 0.20
  - fixture_stability: hash validation on test fixtures = true
  - Metrics block CI, LLM judge provides advisory scores
- [ ] **Wire offline canary tests** with fixture hash validation
  - Create deterministic test cases with fixed evidence inputs
  - Hash validation prevents silent regression
  - Canary tests run on synthetic data (no live API calls in CI)
- [ ] **Create evaluation pipeline** that runs on Markdown output
  - Parse Markdown structure for section analysis
  - Extract claims and validate against evidence citations
  - Score narrative flow and logical progression
  - Generate evaluation reports with specific improvement recommendations

## Technical Implementation Specifications

### LLM Configuration
- **Model:** GPT-4o with deterministic settings (temperature=0, top_p=1, seed=2025)
- **Cassette System:** Record all LLM interactions for reproducible testing and evaluation
- **Caching:** Cache LLM outputs by `(model_id, prompt_sha256, content_sha256)` to reduce costs
- **Rate Limiting:** Respect API limits with exponential backoff and retry logic

### Research-Once-Then-Freeze Architecture Details
- **Single Research Pass:** Complete evidence gathering during initial waterfall phase
- **Evidence Mapping:** Code-based mapping from evidence claims to driver deltas with caps applied
- **Evidence Freezing:** After initial research pass, evidence set becomes immutable
- **Auditability:** Full provenance chain from source URLs → snapshots → evidence → driver changes → valuation

### Agent Separation of Concerns
- **Writer Agent:** Read-only for numbers, must cite evidence IDs for all qualitative claims, generates rich narrative
- **Numeric Agents:** Deterministic calculations only, no LLM involvement in mathematical operations
- **Research Agent:** Single comprehensive pass with evidence extraction and confidence scoring
- **Critic Agent:** Validates citations, blocks uncited claims, prevents number hallucination
- **Router Agent:** Deterministic rule-based routing with comprehensive telemetry logging

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Data Sources → Research Agent → Evidence JSON → Code Mapping → Driver Changes → Valuation Engine
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Snapshots → Evidence Bundle → Model-PR Log → Updated InputsI → ValuationV → Writer Agent
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓  
Manifest → Citations → Audit Trail → Validation → Report → Evaluation
```

### Quality Gates and Success Metrics

**Hard Gates (CI Blocking):**
- `evidence_coverage ≥ 0.80`: At least 80% of qualitative claims must have evidence citations
- `citation_density ≥ 0.70`: At least 0.70 evidence citations per paragraph
- `contradiction_rate ≤ 0.20`: No more than 20% conflicting claims within report
- `fixture_stability = true`: Hash validation on all test fixtures must pass

**Quality Targets:**
- **LLM Judge Scores:** >8/10 on strategic insight, narrative coherence, analytical rigor, professional presentation
- **Benchmark Comparison:** Match or exceed BYD report quality across all evaluation dimensions
- **Professional Standards:** Reports pass blind quality assessment vs human analyst reports
- **Consistency:** Stable output across multiple runs with same inputs (deterministic reproducibility)

### Development Approach

**Evaluation-First Development:**
- All development decisions guided by LLM judge feedback and hard metric performance
- Incremental improvement with continuous evaluation at each step
- No feature considered complete until evaluation scores meet target thresholds

**Evidence-Driven Narrative:**
- Every qualitative claim must be backed by specific evidence citations
- Strategic insights must be grounded in company-specific evidence, not generic industry knowledge
- Investment thesis must synthesize evidence systematically into coherent value creation story

**Scientific Rigor:**
- Deterministic reproducibility: same inputs always produce same outputs
- Full auditability: complete provenance chain from sources to final valuation
- Objective measurement: hard metrics provide unambiguous quality assessment
- Regression prevention: comprehensive testing prevents quality degradation
