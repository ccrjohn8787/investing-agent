# DBOT Quality Gap Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Transform the current numbers-focused valuation system into a story-to-numbers approach matching the quality demonstrated in the DBOT paper's BYD report, with research-once-then-freeze architecture for scientific rigor and reproducibility.

## Background Context

**Current State:**
- Robust valuation engine (Ginzu) with deterministic NumPy calculations ✅
- Complete data pipeline from EDGAR, Yahoo/Stooq, UST sources ✅
- Basic agent structure with LLM integration framework ✅
- Comprehensive evaluation and testing infrastructure ✅
- Basic template-based report generation with minimal narrative context
- Limited strategic analysis and industry context

**Target State (BYD Report Quality):**
- Rich storytelling connecting numbers to business reality
- Industry context and competitive positioning analysis  
- Strategic narrative with bull/bear scenarios
- Compelling titles and thematic structure
- Forward-looking market dynamics integration
- Research-once-then-freeze architecture for reproducibility
- Full auditability with evidence→driver change tracking

**Quality Gap Identified:**
Current META report is purely numeric with minimal narrative. The BYD report demonstrates:
- Industry context and competitive analysis
- Strategic narrative connecting numbers to business reality  
- Market dynamics and forward-looking perspectives
- Compelling titles and thematic structure
- Detailed macro-economic context integration
- Professional-grade investment thesis development

## Strategic Approach: Research-Once-Then-Freeze Architecture

Following the enhanced DBOT approach with scientific rigor:
- **Single Research Pass:** Run comprehensive research during waterfall, map evidence to driver deltas via code under caps, then freeze evidence set
- **Story-to-Numbers:** Rich narrative citing evidence IDs, but writer never creates numbers
- **Full Auditability:** Model-PR log tracks every evidence→driver change with `{evidence_id, target, before→after, rule, cap_hit}`
- **Hard Gates:** Objective metrics block CI (evidence_coverage ≥ 0.80, citation_density ≥ 0.70), LLM judge advises

## Implementation Priorities

### Priority 0: LLM-Based Report Evaluation Framework (CRITICAL FOUNDATION)
**Status:** Ready to Start
**Description:** Build evaluation system that grades reports like Professor Damodaran or investment professionals would, using sub-agent for development
**Dependencies:** None (Foundation for all other work)

**Key Components:**
- LLM judge sub-agent for holistic report evaluation  
- Hard metric gates for CI: evidence_coverage ≥ 0.80, citation_density ≥ 0.70, contradiction_rate ≤ 0.20, fixture_stability = true
- Multi-dimensional rubric scoring system
- BYD report as evaluation benchmark and gold standard
- Evaluation pipeline that runs on Markdown output (not HTML)

- [ ] **Create `report_quality_judge` agent** with professional evaluation criteria
  - Strategic insight scoring (0-10): depth of industry analysis, competitive positioning, forward-looking perspective
  - Narrative coherence scoring (0-10): logical flow, clear investment thesis, compelling storytelling
  - Analytical rigor scoring (0-10): evidence quality, citation discipline, quantitative backing
  - Professional presentation scoring (0-10): formatting, visual integration, clarity
- [ ] **Build comprehensive rubric framework** covering:
  - Strategic insight: industry context, competitive dynamics, market positioning, growth drivers

  - Narrative depth: storytelling quality, executive summary effectiveness, compelling conclusions
- [ ] **Implement BYD report as evaluation benchmark** with detailed scoring framework
  - Parse BYD report sections and score each dimension
  - Create comparative scoring system: current report vs BYD standard
  - Set target thresholds: strategic insight ≥8/10, narrative coherence ≥8/10, analytical rigor ≥9/10
- [ ] **Create evaluation cases for different report types:**
  - Technology companies (high growth, innovation focus): META, GOOGL, NVDA
  - Industrial/Manufacturing (cyclical, capital intensive): BYD reference, CAT, BA
  - Consumer/Retail (brand/competitive moats): AMZN, COST, WMT

- [ ] **Set up hard metric gates in CI** alongside LLM judge
  - evidence_coverage: % of claims backed by evidence IDs ≥ 0.80
  - citation_density: evidence citations per paragraph ≥ 0.70  
  - contradiction_rate: conflicting claims within report ≤ 0.20
  - fixture_stability: hash validation on test fixtures = true
  - Metrics block CI, LLM judge provides advisory scores
- [ ] **Wire offline canary tests** with fixture hash validation
  - Create deterministic test cases with fixed evidence inputs
  - Hash validation prevents silent regression
  - Canary tests run on synthetic data (no live API calls in CI)
- [ ] **Create evaluation pipeline** that runs on Markdown output
  - Parse Markdown structure for section analysis
  - Extract claims and validate against evidence citations
  - Score narrative flow and logical progression
  - Generate evaluation reports with specific improvement recommendations

**Description:** Single research pass that maps evidence to driver changes with full auditability
**Dependencies:** P0 (evaluation framework guides development)

**Key Components:**
- Unified research agent replacing separate news/research functionality
- Three-phase read pattern: headline → lede → full article  
- Evidence JSON schema with driver mapping and confidence scores
- Model-PR log tracking every evidence→driver change
- Evidence freezing after single ingestion - no further input mutations

**Detailed Sub-Tasks:**
- [ ] **Build unified research agent** (merge news + research_llm functionality)

  - Phase 1: Headline analysis - filter for valuation relevance
  - Phase 2: Headline + first paragraph - assess materiality and driver impact  
  - Phase 3: Full article analysis - extract specific claims with confidence scoring
  - Exit early if content deemed non-material for valuation
- [ ] **Create Evidence JSON schema** with standardized structure:
  ```json
  {
    "evidence_bundle": {
      "research_timestamp": "2025-01-27T10:00:00Z",
      "ticker": "META",

            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Build Model-PR log** for complete auditability:
  ```json
  {
    "model_pr_log": {
      "ticker": "META",
      "timestamp": "2025-01-27T10:00:00Z",
      "changes": [
        {

          "cap_applied": false,
          "confidence_threshold": 0.80
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] **Implement evidence ingestion with code-mapped deltas**
  - Parse evidence claims into driver-specific changes
  - Apply caps: growth changes ≤500bps per evidence item, margin changes ≤200bps
  - Confidence threshold filtering: only apply changes with confidence ≥0.80
  - Conflict resolution: higher confidence evidence overwrites lower confidence
- [ ] **Create evidence freezing mechanism**
  - After single research pass, evidence set becomes immutable
  - Later research calls can only propose narrative content, not driver changes
  - Evidence freeze logged in manifest with timestamp and content hash
- [ ] **Add comprehensive evidence snapshot system**
  - Every source captured with `{url, retrieved_at, content_sha256, license_info}`
  - Snapshot storage in `out/<TICKER>/evidence/snapshots/`
  - Provenance chain: source URL → snapshot → evidence claims → driver changes → valuation

**Success Criteria for P1:**
- Single research pass generates comprehensive evidence bundle
- All driver changes fully logged in Model-PR log with provenance
- Evidence freezing prevents run-to-run value drift
- Evaluation framework shows improved evidence coverage (≥0.80)

### Priority 2: Writer/Critic Upgrade (Read-Only + Strict Citations)
**Status:** Pending (Depends on P1 completion)

- Professional-grade narrative sections matching BYD report depth

**Detailed Sub-Tasks:**
- [ ] **Upgrade writer_llm to strict read-only mode** for numeric data
  - Modify `investing_agent/agents/writer_llm.py` to prevent number generation
  - All quantitative claims must reference `[ref:computed:valuation.field]` or `[ev:evidence_id]`
  - Writer can only use numbers already present in `InputsI` or `ValuationV` objects
  - Hard validation: reject any writer output containing novel numeric claims
- [ ] **Implement per-sentence evidence tagging** requirement
  - Every qualitative claim must include `[ev:evidence_id]` citation
  - Strategic assertions must reference specific evidence items
  - Industry context must cite relevant market research or company filings

  - **Strategic Positioning Analysis:** company's competitive advantages, market share dynamics, differentiation factors
  - **Financial Performance Review:** connect historical numbers to strategic narrative, not just recite figures
  - **Forward-Looking Strategic Outlook:** growth drivers, expansion plans, investment priorities (all evidence-backed)
  - **Investment Thesis Development:** synthesize evidence into clear bull/bear scenarios with valuation implications
  - **Risk Factor Analysis:** identify key risks with evidence citations and impact assessment
- [ ] **Build investment thesis development** with professional structure:
  - **Bull Case:** evidence-backed growth drivers, competitive advantages, market expansion opportunities
  - **Bear Case:** evidence-backed headwinds, competitive threats, execution risks
  - **Scenario Analysis:** connect narrative scenarios to valuation sensitivity ranges
  - All scenarios must cite specific evidence items, no generic market assumptions
- [ ] **Enhance critic to detect and block problematic content:**
  - Uncited qualitative claims: any strategic assertion without `[ev:evidence_id]`  
  - Novel numbers: any quantitative claim not in `InputsI`/`ValuationV` objects
  - Contradictory claims: conflicting statements within same report
  - Weak evidence citations: low-confidence evidence used for material claims
  - Generic assertions: claims that could apply to any company in sector
- [ ] **Generate reports in Markdown** for robust LLM evaluation
  - Clean Markdown structure with proper heading hierarchy
  - Evidence citations embedded in natural text flow
  - Tables and charts referenced with computed field citations
  - Professional formatting compatible with both human and LLM evaluation
- [ ] **Create narrative sections with exclusive citation discipline:**
  - Evidence citations: `[ev:evidence_id]` for all qualitative claims
  - Computed references: `[ref:computed:valuation.value_per_share]` for quantitative claims  
  - Table references: `[ref:table:Per-Year Detail]` for data table citations
  - Snapshot references: `[ref:snap:content_sha]` for source document citations

  - SIC code matching: same 4-digit SIC or fall back to 3-digit, then 2-digit
  - Market cap filters: peers within 0.5x to 2x target company market cap
  - Geographic filters: prioritize same region, expand if insufficient peers
  - Minimum peer count: 5 peers required, expand criteria if needed
  - Exclude: penny stocks, recent bankruptcies, extreme outliers (>3σ from median)
- [ ] **Add winsorized multiple calculations** to prevent outlier distortion
  - Winsorize at 5th and 95th percentiles for all multiples
  - Calculate median, mean, and trimmed mean (exclude top/bottom 10%)

  - Compute industry median unlevered beta
  - Re-lever for target company: βₗ = βᵤ × (1 + (1-Tax Rate) × (Debt/Equity))
  - Validate against regression beta, use bottom-up if significant difference
- [ ] **Implement levered WACC path calculation**
  - Cost of equity: Rₑ = Rᶠ + β × (ERP + Country Risk Premium)
  - Cost of debt: Rᵈ = Risk-free rate + Credit spread (based on rating or ratios)
  - WACC = (E/V × Rₑ) + (D/V × Rᵈ × (1-Tax Rate))
  - Dynamic WACC path: adjust debt/equity ratios over forecast period
  - Terminal WACC: normalized capital structure assumptions
- [ ] **Add strict validators** to catch computational errors:
  - Array alignment: all driver paths same length as horizon
  - Terminal constraints: terminal growth < discount rate with 200bps buffer
  - Sanity checks: margins between 0-100%, tax rates 0-50%, positive revenues
  - Cross-validation: debt + equity = enterprise value ± tolerance
  - Peer validation: target multiples within 0.2x-5x of peer median
- [ ] **Create PV/equity bridge validation** to catch silent math corruption
  - Sum of discounted FCFs = PV of explicit period
  - Terminal value calculation verification
  - Enterprise value = PV(explicit) + PV(terminal)  
  - Equity value = Enterprise value - Net debt + Non-operating assets
  - Value per share = Equity value / Shares outstanding
  - Cross-check: implied multiples vs peer multiples for reasonableness

### Quality Gates and Success Metrics

**Hard Gates (CI Blocking):**
- `evidence_coverage ≥ 0.80`: At least 80% of qualitative claims must have evidence citations
- `citation_density ≥ 0.70`: At least 0.70 evidence citations per paragraph
- `contradiction_rate ≤ 0.20`: No more than 20% conflicting claims within report
- `fixture_stability = true`: Hash validation on all test fixtures must pass

**Quality Targets:**
- **LLM Judge Scores:** >8/10 on strategic insight, narrative coherence, analytical rigor, professional presentation
- **Benchmark Comparison:** Match or exceed BYD report quality across all evaluation dimensions
- **Professional Standards:** Reports pass blind quality assessment vs human analyst reports
- **Consistency:** Stable output across multiple runs with same inputs (deterministic reproducibility)

### Development Approach

**Evaluation-First Development:**
- All development decisions guided by LLM judge feedback and hard metric performance
- Incremental improvement with continuous evaluation at each step
- No feature considered complete until evaluation scores meet target thresholds

**Evidence-Driven Narrative:**
- Every qualitative claim must be backed by specific evidence citations
- Strategic insights must be grounded in company-specific evidence, not generic industry knowledge
- Investment thesis must synthesize evidence systematically into coherent value creation story

**Scientific Rigor:**
- Deterministic reproducibility: same inputs always produce same outputs
- Full auditability: complete provenance chain from sources to final valuation
- Objective measurement: hard metrics provide unambiguous quality assessment
- Regression prevention: comprehensive testing prevents quality degradation
