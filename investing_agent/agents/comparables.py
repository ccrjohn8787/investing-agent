    Comparables agent (contract stub â€” eval-first).

    Purpose (per paper):
    - Select peers; compute relative diagnostics (e.g., stable margin band, sales-to-capital distribution);
      propose bounded, defensible tweaks to long-run targets.

    Contract (target state):
    - Inputs: `InputsI`, optional `peers` (with fundamentals) and `policy` (bounds).
    - Output: `InputsI` with small, transparent long-run adjustments grounded in peer stats.
    - Determinism: fully deterministic given peer data.
    - Provenance: cite peer sources and computed stats.

    Current behavior: no-op, returns a deep copy of `I`.
    TODO(M5-comps): implement peer selection + stats + bounds + evals; gate router use on availability.
